A07 - Webscraping


Discription
A07 is an assingment that used two new ideas. webscraping, and pysimple gui. i have not coded in python alot but this program was very simple, but complicated at the same time. 
we scraped data from https://www.wunderground.com/history/
using url maniplulation we where able to pick when where and what type of information we want
Some info consists of Monthly data, or weekly data, or daily data
scraping the data from weekly and mouhtly where the same, but where very dificult
The reason is becasue the info for june 1, 2020 would read something like this for
june 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10...... Max,avg,min 70,68,65,90,85,70
so transposing the collums and rows was nessesarywith daily, the info came out nice and clean where all the info was on one line for a single day
